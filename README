Hi, here you can find some Machine Learning algotithms in R that I already faced in my professional life. In this respository, all codes are in R, but i'll create another one with the same algorthms in Python. 

Sometimes, you'll find some codes with little modifications, because I needed to make some little updates, but the idea behind the code is there.

All directories created, each for a specific algorithm, has the script in R and the example dataset that you can use.

I hope you can use it.

Thanks!
